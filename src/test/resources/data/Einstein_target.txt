	Einstein is a large lunar crater that lies along the western limb of the [[Moon|Moon]], making it difficult to observe from the [[Earth | Planet Earth]]. The visibility of this formation is affected by libration effects, but even under the best conditions not much detail can be observed except from lunar orbit. Nearby craters of note include [[Moseley|Moseley]] just to the north, [[Dalton|Dalton]] along the eastern rim, [[Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]] just to the southeast, and [[Bohr|Bohr]] to the south-southeast. The formation [[Vallis Bohr|vallis Bohr]] is visible to the south.

	Einstein Observatory (HEAO-2) was the first fully imaging [[X-ray telescope|X-ray telescope]] put into space and the second of [[NASA|NASA]]'s three High Energy Astrophysical Observatories. Named HEAO B before launch, the observatory's name was changed to honor Albert Einstein upon its successfully attaining orbit.The Einstein Observatory, HEAO-2, was launched on November 13, 1978, from [[Cape_Canaveral|Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida|Florida]], on an Atlas-Centaur SLV-3D booster rocket into a near-circular orbit with an initial altitude slightly above 500 km. Its orbital inclination orbit was 23.5 degrees. The Einstein Observatory satellite re-entered the Earth's atmosphere and burned up on March 25, 1982.

	The Einstein Tower (German: Einsteinturm) is an astrophysical observatory in the Albert Einstein Science Park in [[Potsdam|Potsdam]], Germany built by [[Erich Mendelsohn]]. It was built on the summit of the Potsdam Telegraphenberg to house a solar telescope designed by the astronomer Erwin Finlay-Freundlich. The telescope supports experiments and observations to validate (or disprove) [[Albert_Einstein|Albert Einstein]]'s relativity theory. The building was first conceived around 1917, built from 1919 to 1921 after a fund-raising drive, and became operational in 1924. Although [[Albert_Einstein|Einstein]] never worked there, he supported the construction and operation of the telescope. It is still a working solar observatory today as part of the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam. Light from the telescope is directed down through the shaft to the basement where the instruments and laboratory are located. There were more than half a dozen telescopes in the laboratory.

	Ulm is a city in the federal German state of [[Baden-Württemberg]], situated on the [[River Danube]]. The city, whose population is estimated at 120,000 (2006), forms an urban district of its own ({{lang-de|Stadtkreis}}) and is the administrative seat of the [[Alb-Donau (district)|Alb-Donau district]]. Ulm, founded around 850, is rich in history and traditions as a former [[Free Imperial City]] ({{lang-de|freie Reichsstadt}}). Today, it is an economic centre due to its varied industries, and it is the seat of the [[University of Ulm]]. Internationally, Ulm is primarily known for having the church with the tallest steeple in the world (161.53 m or 529.95 feet), the Gothic minster ([[Ulm Minster]], German: Ulmer Münster) and as the birthplace of [[Albert Einstein]].

It includes 16 [[States of Germany|constituent states]] and covers an area of {{convert|357,021|km2|sqmi}} with a largely temperate seasonal climate. Its [[capital city|capital]] and [[List of cities in Germany by population|largest city]] is [[Berlin]]. With 81 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state in the [[European Union]]. After the United States, it is the second most popular [[Immigration to Germany|migration destination]] in the world.

	General relativity, also known as the '''general theory of relativity''', is the [[Differential geometry|geometric]] [[Theoretical physics|theory]] of [[gravitation]] published by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1915 and the current description of gravitation in [[modern physics]]. General relativity generalizes [[special relativity]] and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of [[space]] and [[Time in physics|time]], or [[spacetime]]. In particular, the [[curvature]] of spacetime is directly related to the [[energy]] and [[momentum]] of whatever [[matter]] and [[radiation]] are present. The relation is specified by the [[Einstein field equations]], a system of [[partial differential equation]]s.
